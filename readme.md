# Hammer Engine work

This is part of an independent project of mine to port one of my wargames to the PC. I do not work on this project regularly, so it's mostly a testing ground for my own experimental programming and learning.

In this repo specifically, I've implemented:
 - A basic event system that can handle scheduled events
 - Timing mechanisms
 - A locator structure that can arrange itself into a linked tree for efficiency
 - Some work on weapons
 - Some simple tests of these features
